we are making an iOS scenekit 3D hand gesture recognition tracking based game where you use your fingers to move a golf club. we are making an isometric hand/gesture recognition mini golf game, You as the player will complete several mini golf courses using your fingers/hands to make the golf club hit the ball and send it around the course. After you have hit the golf ball, if you don’t get the ball in the hole, You try again until you do. There is no time limit, But your goal is to try get the ball in the hole in as few turns as possible. tapping on the game area lets the player move their golf club to a different position and angle. Users taps on a spot then drags from that point to indicate which spot and direction they want the golf club to be in. Hand swing controls should track a hands index finger and thumb, making a flick motion (separating the thumb and index finger dots) swings the club, depending on the speed of the flick determines the speed of the swing, Separating the fingers slowly does a small hit, Doing a large flick or separating the index finger and thumb quickly does a large hit- hand tracking will track the whole hand, Use the middle finger tracking to improve the performance of the index/thumb tracking, Only the index finger and thumb will have visible tracking dots, But tracking of the whole hand should be prioritised in the vision usage. If required, Use head tracking/identification to distinguish the hand features from facial features which may be in frame. Use every available vision trick without affecting performance and reuse code from /Users/aristideslintzeris/Documents/XcodeProjects/GestureFlow/GestureFlow project which already figured out the pinch tracking pretty well. 

the index finger and thumb will have transparent dots/circles to indicate their position on screen. 
The front facing camera will be used, But not displayed in gameplay, 
The index finger and thumb dots will be displayed on screen, and move with the players hands. 
The 2 finger dots will be tracked to the tips of the users index finger and thumb. which is based on the two dots starting point > the point where their swing ends. Create game logic for losing and regaining the hand tracking, If the index finger and thumb dots are lost before separating reset the club and don’t swing it, Wait till you have re-aquired the hand. Make the game work with either hand. The game is played in portrait mode. One hand holds the phone and selects the spot and angle to shoot from, the other hand is held out so the front facing camera can track it. Users can change where they are standing infinitely but once their club hits the ball their turn is passed. The first iteration of the game will be single player, But we may implement multiplayer at a later stage. The user has to correctly swing their club to hit the ball into the hole, If the player hits too hard they can hit the ball outside of the area, This setting can be changed to make the edge objects have a square invisible barrier around them that keeps the ball in the area no matter how hard the user hits it. When the user hits the ball so hard it hits the invisible wall, It should ripple like the surface of water but glass like. Visual Style is minimalist cartoony 3D isometric topdown view. User can rotate the game area by swiping left/right outside the “game area” where the mini golf course is, The outside “background” should be a lite blue minimalist ocean gradient animation with randomised elements and noise on animation functions. The UI will use pre-existing paid for UI assets, To make the game feel warm, cartoony, playful and engaging. 

The game will have several courses of increasing difficulty, Players can also use the "editor mode" to create their own courses using the mini golf 3D objects that will be used in game. They can stick them together like legos and rotate them to create new engaging courses. Users can share their courses, By purchasing the full game. When the iOS app first opens, request the camera permission immediately, and direct users to the settings for the app if the permission isn’t granted. This is so the front facing camera can be used properly for vision tracking. 

Write a technical outline explaining how to accomplish this. format for humans and AI.
